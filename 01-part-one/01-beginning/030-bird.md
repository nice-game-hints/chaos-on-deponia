There is a bird-shaped hole in the bathroom door.

# Open
Open the toilet door.

# Poor John Thomas
Yeah yeah. Grab the bird.

# Ouch
He is in the toilet now and the toilet is not working. Did you blow a fuse?

# I did
Well, fix it. Take the Power Inverter from the Toolbox and put it in the Box.

# And?
And flush! The water should go to the other direction now.

# The Bird!
Try the Flush Button on the sink.
