You need a Hammer to help Bozo. Doc knows where the hammer is.

# Where?
Open the toolbox below the mushroom thingy. Grab the Hammer.

# Oops..
You said you would be more careful! Free the bird, now!

# Where did it go?
Which one? [The Hammer is under the table](020-find-hammer.md) (use spacebar to see all the possible targets) and [there is a bird-shaped hole in the bathroom door](030-bird.md).
