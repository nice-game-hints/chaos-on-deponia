The Hammer is under the table. Try to be careful!

# Fire!
Quick! Get some water! There is the sink. Flush!

# The Flush button does not work!
Did you check the bathroom? [Fill the sink with Water.](030-bird.md)

# Water
Soak the cloath in the water and suffocate the fire.

# Stuck
Oh my. Did it get stuck on the garbage disposal? The one that activates from the other button?

# Other button?
There is another button right of the sink. Press that!

# Oh my!
Well, at least you have the soaked tablecloth. You can suffocate the fire! Use the cloath to the fire.

# Yeah, right
Oh, you just grabbed the hammer and... Well, you have the hammer now. Are you going to...? No? Ok.
