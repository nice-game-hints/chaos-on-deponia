Nice machine you have built there, Rufus. Is it starting from the Bellows?

# I guess
Push the Bellows to get the machine going! You have calculated everything, haven't you?

# Doc!
Uh oh, he is *heading* the wrong direction. What to do?

# What?
Oh yeah, these are the hints, right! Could you get some kind of tool?

# Tool?
There is a knife on the pan.

# Knife!
Step on the panhandle.

# I have the knife
By using the try-and-fail method you should find out that the correct answer is the fireworks above Rufus' head!

# Black powder
The black powder is on the pan. Step on the panhandle again.

# In the bellows
The powder is now in the bellows. So, step on it again!
