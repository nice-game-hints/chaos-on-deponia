Nod "urged" Rufus to join the Unorganized Crime at the tavern. Rufus should just do something reckless, like shaving the boss lady's cat. They have a hide-out.

# Where?
They have a submersible at the Little Venice.

# I want in
[Go into the submersible.](054-submersible.md)

# I'm in
This is the submersible of the Unorganized Crime. There is not much to do. When you enter the Radio Room you get to talk to Cletus and get some slides from him. Also, a button appears.

# Pushed the button
The kitty appears. Now, shave it! Note that you have to have had the discussion with Nod (at the Tavern) before Rufus is ready to shave the cat.

# With what?
You would need some kind of impromptu razor.

# Razor?
Or, razor fish... Shave the kitty with the [Razorfish](/02-part-two/043-razorfish.md).

# Umm.. shaved something, I think
There is a skippable (after one try) minigame of trying to get Donna's twitches to match your proposals.

# I'm in!
Congrats! You are now part of the Unorganized Crime.
