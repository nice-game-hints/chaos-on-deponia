You should ask the Shop-O-Mat about the empty pedestal. That's where the Golden Dragon is but he is watching you. Ask more also. He says you can try the gadgets (not the Golden Dragon, though) before you buy.

# Can I?
You can try for example the Juicer Hat. You just need something to juice on it. [The Pharmacist has free samples.](056-cucumber.md)

# I got ... something
It is the Cucumber of Revelation. You should try it. Combine it with the juicer.

# Revelation
There you have it! Just fool the tin can to try the broken sun glasses.

# Can't reach them
You can try other items at the store also. Like anti-gravity socks. You should reach the glasses now.

# I got them
Hand them to Shop-O-Mat. Do you get them free if the product is broken?

# They are not broken
Well, the label says they are *indestructable*. Let's see about that.

# Yeah!
Put the glasses into the Shredder.

# They weren't indestructible
Now, act according the revelation. Give the glasses to Shop-O-Mat.

# He says those are not broken
Well, if that is the case he will not see you take the Dragon? Go get the Golden Dragon of Invisibility. Snatch the sunglasses also.
