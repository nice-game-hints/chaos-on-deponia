Fire Platypus eggs are hidden in hot geysers. There is not hot geysers here. Is there something similar?

# Is there?
There is an egg in the funnel on top of Doc's Workshop. Go up and grab the egg.

# Oh crap!
Hahhaa, you didn't think it was that easy?

# How do I get it out?
There is the furnace below. Maybe having a fire there would push the egg away from the funnel.

# Fire!
No torch this time. Put a coal there and lit it.

# With what?
Get [a candle](/02-part-two/034-crane-the-poet.md), lit it and lit the coal.

# How do I lit the candle?
At the tavern there is another candle you can use to light your own candle. Light the furnace.

# Egg is free!
No it's not! It is in the pipe system. It is a skippable minigame where you try to guide the egg to the bottom pipe.

# Solved it
The egg hatches automatically and you can grab the fire platypus. It's nest is on the left of the furnace. There it will guard the nest and fire platypus is out of the menu.
