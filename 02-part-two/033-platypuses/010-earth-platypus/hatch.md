The earth platypus eggs are hatched in frost soil.

# Soil
There is no frozen soil anywhere. Maybe you could create the conditions somehow. First, you need the soil-to-go.

# Using what?
For example a bucket would be good device to carry soil around.

# A bucket
There is a bucket hanging on a pole next to the fisherman. At the Dock.

# I have a bucket
Fill it with soil. The same soil where you found the egg. There is a tub full of soil at Bellevue.

# Bucket filled with soil
Nice, you have now soil-to-go. Now, just get it frozen.

# Freezer
If I recall correctly there is a Freezer at Doc's workshop.

# And then?
Get to Doc's workshop, put the egg into the bucket filled with soil and put all of that into the freezer. The platypus hatches!
