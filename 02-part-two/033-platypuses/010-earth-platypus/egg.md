Earth Platypus eggs are hidden in soil.

# Find the egg
You don't have to travel far from the Platypus Club. There is a patio next to the entrance to Bellevue. Go get the egg from the soil.

# Ow!
The rake is in the way. You should get rid of it. Could someone have a need for it?

# Like?
Like Hoedown the Gardener on the other side. He is almost done.

# Why would he need the rake then?
Kick the tree next to him.

# Revenge!
Get back to Bellevue and the rake is gone!

# The egg
There is a skippable minigame where you need to catch the meerkat by blocking its movement with the stones.
