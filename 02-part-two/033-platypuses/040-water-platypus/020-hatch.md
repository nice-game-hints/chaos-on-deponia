The water platypus egg is hatched inside a *living* zebrafish.

# FIsh
[Go get a fish, first](030-fish.md).

# Tigerfish
Yeah, its not quite zebrafish. It is wrong color.

# Wrong color?
Maybe you could color it to look like a zebrafish.

# Where
There is a paint bucket at the Doc's Workshop yard. Go and color the fish there.

# Hatching
Insert the egg into the zebrafish mouth.

# Living zebrafish?
True, it is not quite livid, isn't it? You have to bring some life to the frankenfish.

# How?
*Franken*fish, see what I did there?

# Don't get it
You should electrocute it to bring it back to life. There is Electrodes at Doc's Workshop lock.

# It's alive!
Yeah. What the heck happened during that, though? Well, onwards. Get that fish into a water.

# Where
Like, an aquarium. There is an aquarium at Seagull's house.

# Can't make it
Does Frankenfish pass out during your way onto Bellevue?

# Yes
You should refresh it with [fresh water](/02-part-two/034-crane-the-poet.md) every time it starts to twitch. Get the fish into Seagull's Goldfish Bowl.

# I made it!
Great. You should now have the Water Platypus. It's nest is at the Harbor on top of the pole near the Gondola. It will now guard the nest and water platypus is out of the menu.
