According to the guide the flying platypus eggs are hatched by dropping them from the highest point of their habitat.

# High point
Naturally, that place is somewhere in Bellevue. Look hint from the guide.

# Landing net
There is a windsock that looks like in the illustration attached to [the mast on top of Seagull's house](030-high-point.md).

# It is too high
Did you look at the Pipe?

# Human ashes
Hmm.. yes. By inserting human ashes into the pipe you get the "flag" to half-mast. Logical!

# Human ashes
There is an urn at the Poet's room under the Seagull's House. [Get the urn](/02-part-two/034-crane-the-poet.md) and put the ashes into the pipe.

# Half mast but no dice
You can't yet insert the egg into the windsock. It would go through it.

# Tie it
You could tie it with [the thread](/02-part-two/034-crane-the-poet.md). If you try it you get hint what is Rufus' plan. A catapult! You just need one more component to trigger the catapult.

# What is it?
A hook. You get one from the fisherman. He has a jar of hooks.

# I have a hook
You have a thread and a hook. You played the first Deponia game, right? You know what to do with them. Thread with a hook!

# Again?
Well, yeahmm.. Anyways. Go and attach the thread with a hook to the Windsock and attach the hook to the Grommer.

# Catapult ready
Load it with the egg and shoot!

# No
You have to stretch it to get the egg flying really good. [Raise the mast back up.](040-mast.md)

# Risen
Great the catapult is ready to launch.

# Can't unknot
Isn't that double negative? Anyways, maybe you could cut it with something.

# Like?
Like a sword. Or swordfish. Or [razorfish](/02-part-two/043-razorfish.md)!
