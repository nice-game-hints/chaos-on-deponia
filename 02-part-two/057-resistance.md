The resistance hideout is at the Dark Alley. Garlef (at the Tavern) will know the secret knock. [You have to beat him in rock-paper-scissors game](/02-part-two/053-rock-paper-scissors.md).

# He's done
Great. Now, head to the Dark Alley and knock the door.

# I get it wrong
Yeah, its the funky music at the Marketplace that messes Rufus's head. If you just could get past the Marketplace without hearing the music.

# But how?
Well, this is totally meta way to solve the puzzle. Go to the Tavern and ask the secret knock again from Garlef.

# Okay
Then, **before** you go to the Marketplace...

# Yes?
Oh boy, you are not gonna guess it...

# Come on!
Open the main menu...

# What!?
And put your Music setting to silent...

# You gotta be kidding me
And walk over the silent marketplace. So meta!

# That guy won't let me in
Yeah, he only remembers the old knock.

# How do I get that now?
If you could hear someone using it.

# Like?
Like that guy who is requesting it from you. Do some knocking with him.

# And then?
Hide in the Crate until he comes out. You have to knock the door couple of times with him to get him out after you hide. You hear the old knock from him.

# I'm in
Put on the music again
