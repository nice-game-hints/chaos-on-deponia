The submersible is at Little Venice. You should first try to just enter it from the hatch.

# He doesn't let me in
Yeah, Wink is on guard at the submersible. He saw you approac through the periscope with his *left eye*.

# Did he say something about Golden Dragon...
Golden Dragon of Invisibility. [You can find it from the Gadget Store.](055-golden-dragon.md)

# I have it
I hope you snatched the broken sunglasses also. Just in case...

# Yeah, I have those too
Go to Little Venice and use your invisibility gadget.

# I lost it
Didn't surprise me! You still have the glasses of darkness from the gadget shop?

# I do
Wink sees you from the Periscope. Could you block the view somehow?

# Like?
Put the lens on the left frame. Combine that with the right frame to get repaired glasses. Use the glasses to block the view from the periscope.

# Done
Enter the submersible.
