To enter Bellevue you need to get past the sniffer. He doesn't let you in.

# Sniffer
The nose. How would you avoid the sniffing?

# Don't know
What kind of nose does not smell?

# Ill?
Yup. Can you give the nose a flu?

# With what?
With germs, of course.

# Germs?
If you have talked enough with Lady Goal and Gulliver you should have obtained the germy peanuts. Let the nose sniff them a little.
