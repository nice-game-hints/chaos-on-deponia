By joining the Platypus Club you get all the benefits of a new member. Including the Field Guide to platypus.

# Membership cards
As Platypus Trapper tells you he hides membership cards into the restaurant fortune cookies.

# Really?
Yes he does. 

# Fortune cookies
They are served as an extra at the restaurant. Ring the bell and ask more. Order some take-out.

# Ordering
It is a skippable minigame where you try to get only the fortune cookie by switching stuff on your order. (Don't you really have any money?)

# Fortune cookie?
What does it say?

# No luck
Maybe you are not meant to win the club membership. Is there someone with better luck?

# Who?
There was the really lucky fisherman at the Dock. Give the fortune cookie to him.

# That lucky...
Anyways, you now have the membership card. Go show it to Platypus Trapper. You will get the Guide. Read it well.
