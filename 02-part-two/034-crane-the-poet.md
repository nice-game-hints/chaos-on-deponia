The Poet (located in the room under the Seagull's House) has all kinds of nifty things you need during your stay at Deponia. Talk to him.

# Pathetic
He is. But he also stated that he doesn't need stuff that Captain Seagull needs.

# Interesting
If you could tell him what Seagull needs, he would propably give away that stuff.

# How?
If you could get hand-written notes from the Captain about stuff he needs. Start by looking and touching the bookshelf.

# A memo
You got a memo for the candle. Try to get Seagull to write more memos by observing stuff in his room.

# A list, please
 - Bread memo, look at the godlfish bowl
 - Water memo, look at the flower
 - Coal memo, look at the window
 - Thread memo, after you have all the other memos
 
# The poet
Now, one by one give the memos to Crane.

# He's done
He doesn't need anything anymore. You can now grab what you want.
