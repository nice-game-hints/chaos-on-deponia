You need a living *zebrafish*.

# Fish
Who knows about fishes? The fisherman, of course. Go to him and talk to him, multiple times.

# He doesn't like me
You have to prove him that you are a fisherman, also.

# How?
Like show him a big fish you "caught". Show him the [razorfish](/02-part-two/043-razorfish.md)!

# How did you catch it?
You used the special bait of course. The anchovy-on-a-stick, of course! He promised to give you a tigerfish (that is not a zebrafish, though).

# Where is the bait?
You must have dumped it somewhere when you ended the first game.

# Like?
Like in the Bozo's Cutter (right of the Dock). Go inside it and search through the trash can.

# My old bait!
Cool. Show it to the fisherman.

# I can't catch the fish
Oh yeah. You should stun the fish to catch (pick it up, actually).

# Stun?
Like, improve the fisherman's bait so that it will also stun the fish. You have stunned before.

# I have?
Like Toni in the first game? Use some drugs.

# Where to get them?
The Pharmacist's Dumpster probably contains interesting things. Go search it.

# Expired drugs
The fish don't care. Use the pills on the bucket of bait and give your better bait to the fisherman, again. You now have a *tigerfish*.
