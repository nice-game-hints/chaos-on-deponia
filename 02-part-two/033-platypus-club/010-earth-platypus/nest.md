You have hatched the Earth Platypus and now it should be transfered to its nest. But it's angry!

# Tame it
Did you notice how the freezer works?

# The button
Yes, the button froze the water. Push the button to melt it again.

# It swims
It can swim, it is a platypus after all. Now, how can you tame it?

# How?
Press the button again. Some ice will do it.

# Ice block
It is tight. You need tools.

# Like?
Like a spade. You can find one from the same place where you found the egg.

# I have it. It's cold.
Put it on it's nest at the round patio where you found the egg. It will now guard the nest and keep earth platypus out of the menu.
