The flying platypus has hatched and it is floating there. Can you lure it back to its nest?

# Lure
Look hint from the guide. There is a weird illustration.

# Landing net
Did you grab the windsock? Got get it.

# Where do I put it?
Not so fast. The landing net needs something else also. Look at the illustration.

# Is that?
It is an Antenna. You can get one from Little Venice.

# I have the antenna
Combine it with the windsock. You have a landing net!

# Now, where?
Whoa whoa. First, lure the platypus to some cozy place.

# Like?
There is the bird house next to the nose.

# How do I lure it?
They like [bread](/02-part-two/034-crane-the-poet.md). Put the bread into the Birdhouse.

# It is near
Catch it with your Landing Net!

# Where's the nest?
At the Old Town there is a platypus nest. Put it there and it will guard the nest. Flying platypus is out of the menu now.
