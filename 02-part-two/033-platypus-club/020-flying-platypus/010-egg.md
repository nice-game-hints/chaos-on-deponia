According to the guide the Flying Platypus lays its blue-ish egg to high places. Go find it!

# Can't
High place is of course somewhere in Bellevue.

# Where?
It is in the green sock over the restaurant.

# Ah, there it is
Go get it by walking Up

# Can't reach
There is the crankshaft *without a crank*.

# Crank
Who could have these kind of spare parts?

# Dunno
You can find the crank from Doc's spareparts shop (After the first door to Doc's Workshop). It is on the shelf.

# I have a crank
Use the crank to crank the egg closer and grab it.
