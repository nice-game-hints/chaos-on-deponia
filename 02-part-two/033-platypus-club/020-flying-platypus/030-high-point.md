There is the interesting place with the windsock and a mast on top of Seagull's House.

# How to get there
First, you should go into the house (and greet Seagull if you haven't already).

# There's no stairs
Maybe they are behind a secret door. Pretty common secret door, actually.

# Like?
The bookshelf. Go touch the books (you know what they are, don't you?). You will get a note from Seagull about candles.

# And then?
Go touch the book again. You will find a book about pulling it to open a secret door. Pull that book.
