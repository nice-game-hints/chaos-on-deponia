Here's how to raise the mast back up.

# How?
You should get the ashes away so that the mast goes back up.

# Pipe?
You can't get them from the pipe. It is only for inserting stuff.

# Where then?
There is a hatch that is attached to the Flag-O-Mat in the secret door. Open it.

# Opened
Open the lint trap. The ashes have caught in the lint trap.

# Not using my fingers
Use the vacuum cleaner on the left of the ladder. The mast is back up.
