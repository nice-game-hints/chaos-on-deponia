Doc's lab is in the Industrial Park. There go to the door on the right. You are on the entry way.

# Doc's lab?
It is on the right. Just go pass the guard dog and open the door.

# I am not accromited!
Did you talk to the dog? That piece of junk thinks you are funny! Just don't over-circuit it.

# Over-circuit?
I dunno. It is a dog after all. Could you play fetch with it?

# With what?
There is a stick in the junk heap. Use it to the dog.

# It doesn't fetch it
You go fetch it. It is laughing again so hard that the lamp flickers!

# Lamp
Go check the lamp. Maybe it is connected to the dog somehow.

# Buzz
The dog is amused! Maybe you could charge the stick from the lamp. Use the stick to the lamp.

# Wahahahaa!
That stupid dog. The stick is charged. How can you pick it up?

# Insulate?
There is some Electrical Tape on the self. Grab it and use it on the charged stick.

# Insulated
You have now the Insulated and Highly Charged Stick. You will show the dog who is the superior species here. Use the stick to the dog!

#  Errmm..
Hmm, well, you showed him who is the superior... well, you got in!
