*Lady Goal* is hungry but not fancying the cuisine served at the tavern.

# A romantic dinner
I think she was little excited about invitation to a nice romantic dinner. No peanuts!

#  Bozo
Go talk to Bozo. He will give you advice about Lady Goal **after you have talked with all the Goal's personalities**.

# Seagull
He lives at the fancy part of the town: [Bellevue](031-bellevue.md). When you get in enter the Manor on right.

# Seagull?
You mean dad? Shoking, I know. Talk to him about Goal. He tells you that you should take her to Chez Schlumpi at the Old Town. [Reserve the table at Sclumpi](032-dinner-table.md).

# It's a date
Nice, you should now have the invitation. Show it to Lady Goal.

# That louse!
Seagull has done it for the last time! They are in the Old Town as we speak!

# To the restaurant!
They are having the dinner. Goal thinks Captain can really treat a lady. He has stolen your ideas of having the dinner with Goal.

# He has, yes
Also the idea about using the prompter for the poem. Maybe you could make him lose it by using Crane's radio.

# How do I get it?
There's another note on Seagull's table, about radio equipment. Take it and show it to Crane.

# I have the radio
Who gives worst poems around here?

# Who?
The Platypus Trapper of course. Give the radio to him.
