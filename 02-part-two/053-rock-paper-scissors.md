If you want to play Rock-Paper-Scissors with Garlef you need the official tournament hand. Where have I seen it?

# Where?
Ask Nod about it. He also plays.

# Hideout
The hand is visible at the Little Venice. You can see it from the submersible window. It is the submersible of Unorganized Crime. [Join the crime organization](051-join-crime.md) to get access to the bridge.

# I'm in
You can now enter the bridge and get the official tournament hand.

# Play!
Yes, go play with Garlef for access to the resistance. It is a skippable mini-game of (really weird) RPS.
