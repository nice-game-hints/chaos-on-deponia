The blind pharmacist has free samples! Neat. It is the Cucumber of Revelation. Perfect for... um... all kinds of things.

# I need a coupon
He said he read a magazine on a toilet. Because he is blind he uses braille writing.

# Okay
[Maybe you should visit the toilet at Gulliver's.](052-bathroom.md)

# Toilet paper
All you got was very rough toilet paper covered with bumps. Just like ... braille.

# And?
Give the toilet paper to the pharmacist and he will hand you the cucumber.
