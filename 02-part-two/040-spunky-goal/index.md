*Spunky Goal* is more straightforward personality of Goal. Talk to her.

# She wants to fight
Yeah, she has temper. You are not allowed to fight at Gully's though.

# Bozo
Go talk to Bozo. He will give you advice about Spunky Goal **after you have talked with all the Goal's personalities**. Talk about ladies and about Spunky Goal.

# Right words
Yes, ask more about those.

# He doesn't tell them
Maybe you could eavesdrop? Convince him to pay a visit to his Bambina. The Little Venice is just left from the Harbor (where you exit to from the tavern) and the Weapons Shop is left again.

# Sharp-dressed Bozo
Convince him to face his Bambina. Bozo will tell the magic words to her!

# Can't hear them
Where did that Gondolier come from? He is singing some crappy melody that will cause them to part. [You should interrupt that singer first.](045-interrupt-gondolier.md)

# Gondolier, taken care of
Wow, harsh! But hey! Hello, doll... Go say those words to Goal.

# How to fight Goal?
There are instructions on the wall.
**I** Goal will look at the position she will attack. Select that position on Rufus.
**II** Goal will defend certain parts. Select the unshielded part on Goal.

Good luck!
