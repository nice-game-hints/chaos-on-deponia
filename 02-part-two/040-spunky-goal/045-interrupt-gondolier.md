The Junkcrabs are the key here to interrupt that annoying Gondolier from messing up the meeting with Bozo and Bambina.

# Crabs?
Yes, they live in the Dark Alley (next to the Marketplace) in the heap on junk. The *yellow* pipe is in their hearing vincinity.

# Ok
Next, have you tried to kick the Bumper in the gondola?

# Now I have
Good! The gondolier will fetch a replacement bumper from the crate next to the entrance to Doc's shop.

# That's good, I guess
It is. That crate is under the *green* pipe.

# Crabs, grate?
Did you know that the crabs really like the song Mating of the Junk Crabs (naturally)?

# No?
They do. If you could get the condolier to sing that song under the *red* pipe the crabs would get moving. [Get a music sheet for Mating of the Junk Crabs.](060-music-sheet.md)

# The condolier has it
So, you gave the music sheet to the condolier, nice. Now, if he sings it (persuade Bozo to try it again) the crabs will appear in the *red* Pipe opening.

# Red, Yellow, Green?
Okay, there is a Pipe Diverter (why not?) next to the Pharmacy at the Marketplace. It will control what pipe is connected to what. So, you should get the Crabs lured to the *green* pipe by singing to them through the *red* pipe that will produce the sound out of *yellow* pipe. Easy!

# Help me!
Okay, make sure the pipe diverter is connecting the *red* and the *yellow* pipes (default). Persuade Bozo and see the crabs appear in the red pipe opening.

# Done
Then, close the Pipe Valve in the red pipe opening.

# Closed
Go to the marketplace and swith the pipe diverter so that the *red* and *green* pipes are connected. Release the valve. The crabs drop into the crate with the replacement airbag.

# I see
Then go and kick the bumper. Next time the condolier sings the mating song the crabs will go wild!
