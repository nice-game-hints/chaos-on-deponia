The condolier only has one music sheet. You should get him something else to sing.

# Music sheets
Is there any other music device around here?

# Jukebox
There is a jukebox at the Gulliver's. Have you examined it?

# The flap
The flap is screwed closed. There was a screwdriver at Doc's lab on the table.

# I have it
Screw the flap open.

# Alex
So, that's how it works! Nice. And there's some musical notes for you.

# He doesn't give them
Talk to Gulliver about the jukebox. [Make the tavern darker.](/02-part-two/045-dark.md)

It is, but someone has to do it. Now you can grab the musical notes according your song selection.
