You can't reserve a table at Chez Schlumpi using your Dad's name before you remove all platypush dishes from its menu. Schlumpi is at [Bellevue](031-bellevue.md) on the left.

# Chez Schlumpi
Talk to the (shady) restaurant keeper. He won't let you reserve the table.

# Any more hints?
Well, go talk to the other guy, the Platypus Trapper.

# Interesting
It is! He supplies the restaurant with platypuses. If you could short the supply maybe they would remove platypus food from the list.

# How?
It seems that you really should get [membership in the Platypus Club first](033-platypus-club/index.md).

# I am a member
If you read the field guide you should get that you have to find four platypus eggs, hatch them and put the platypuses into their nests to guard them.

# Menu is clear
Nicely done! Go talk to Seagull.

# A poem?
This isn't fair! Argh, where would you get a poem?

# A poet?
True. Go visit Crane the Poet downstairs.

# I don't buy it
He is just trying to get rid of you. Do you have any other poems to recite to him?

# Like
From a postcard, or such.

# Postcard
There are greeting cards at the Platypus Club. Ask the Trapper more about the cards. Ask him to recite you a poem!

# Ugly poem
Go tell it to Crane. Let's see if he can take it!

# I got a bug
Yuck. Well, at least he is helping you. Go tell the poem to Seagull.

# I have an invitation!
Nice, *you* can now have the date with Lady Goal!
