After you have gone through getting past Janosch (Liebold's remote) and meeting your future self you are faced with the Unorganized Crime. You would have to get rid of Nod and Wink and get the gun.

# Okay
Did you talk to Doc?

# Yes
He said something about Donna's implant.

# Where is it?
The remote is in the Drawer. Try it on Donna.

# Rats
There's no cartridge in Donna's remote. Where would you get a cartridge?

# Who?
Go talk to Goal. You can grab the cartridge when you tell Goal about the champagne.

# Got it
Put the Lady Goal cartridge into Donna's remote and use it on Donna.
