# What are the winning numbers?
Yes, to win in lottery you would have to know the winning numbers.

# Who knows them?
Go ask the Seer. He is in the tent at Porta Fisco. Ask him about lottery numbers.

# He doesn't tell them
But he said that he has changed to couples counseling.

# Couples counseling?
Go get your couple into the tent. Change her to Baby Goal to succeed.

# Interesting questions
Yes, you can have all kinds of interesting information. Everything goes smoothly. Maybe too smoothly.

# What do you suggest?
Say to the Seer that this is humbug. He will point the ball and you get the cursor back. Switch Baby Goal to Spunky Goal.

# She doesn't like it
Keep asking the questions. She will lose it on the (every) third question.

# Uh oh
What were you after? The lottery numbers. Time the third question to be about wealth.

# He told it
The lottery numbers will be seen in the stars! Stars?

# Stars
There are stars in the sky at the North Pole. Go look at them.

# 8,43,...
If you have looked at the stars you should get the lottery prize coupon from the Lott-O-Mat.
