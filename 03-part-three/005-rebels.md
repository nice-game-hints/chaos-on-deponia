There ought to be a Rebel Hideout at Porta Fisco. It is at the green alley bottom of the screen.

# How to get in?
Just go knocking the door.

# What is the secret knock?
You have the new secret knock note?

# How does it work?
You first knock n times (like 3). Then someone answers you. You add these knock and knock that many times (like 4). Then someone answers you. You subtract that many knocks and answer with that (like 1). And then again you add the knocks. It is a skippable minigame.
