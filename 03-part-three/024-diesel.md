You need Diesel to power up some machines.

# Where?
First, you need a container. There is a Canister at Rebel Camp (at Porta Fisco).

# I have the canister
There is a Diesel Generator at Isla Watchit. You should extract some diesel into the canister.

# How?
The tank is too hot when the generator is running. You should put it out of order for a while.

# With what?
Block the exhaust pipe.

# With?
A banana, of course. You find bananas from the Seer Tent (at Porta Fisco). Just try to take the bananas until you submit to your fate.

# Submitted
Stick a banana into the exhaust pipe.

# No tools
You would need a hose of some kind to siphon the diesel into the canister. There is a hose at North Pole.

# I have it
Put the hose into the diesel generator. Then use the canister.
