To dodge the lightning at Isla Watchit you also need some water to put the *lightnin rod* in.

# How?
A *pool* of water should suffice.

# A pool?
Did you visit the Rebel Hideout already? There is the waddle pool with baby dolphins in it. [Move baby dolphins away from the pool first](015-dolphins.md)

# Done
Well done, I guess... You have the pool where your lightning rod can be placed. Go put the pool into the plateuau (at Isla Watchit) and pump some water into it from the Pump next to it.
