You need a tree for your lightning rod.

# Where?
Hmm.. this is a tricky one to hint. Have you noticed the Old Power Turbine next to the Rebel Camp (at Porta Fisco)?

# I have
Its tank is empty. [Get some diesel](024-diesel.md) and fill the tank with it.

# Filled
Now, the turbine will move air from the camp into the smelly Porta Fisco. What would happen if the smelly air would go into the camp?

# What?
Let's try. There is a hatch in the turbine. Put in a power inverter there. You can find one on top of the ramp at Porta Fisco. Stick the power inverter into the hatch.

# Air freshener trees
Aha! A tree is a tree. They have air freshener trees in the camp now. Grab one, grab all.
