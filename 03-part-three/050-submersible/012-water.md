Add some water into the diving suit so that it looks more like a human.

# Water
There is a Water faucet on the Cutter.

# No hose
If you dive down in the diving suit you find two hoses.

# Two *short* hoses
Combine the hoses to make a long hose. Attach the hose to the faucet and then put the hose into the suit. Then use the faucet to insert water into the suit.
