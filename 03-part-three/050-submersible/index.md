The submersible is next to the Cutter but the Hatch is locked.

# Locked
Maybe you could try accessing the submersible under the water.

# Diving
But not without a suit!

# Diving suit
You find one from the Locker. Attach the Diving Suit to the Hook.

# I'm down there
Press the Button. The dolphins don't like you. I think they are ready to attack you!

# Yelp!
Maybe you could devise some kind of decoy-you to send there first.

# Decoy-me?
The diving suit should look likea human target. [Add water to the diving suit](012-water.md) and [make a face mold of you](013-mold.md).

# Target ready!
Ask Bozo to lower the dummy into the water.

# Kaboom
Enter the diving suit and enter the submersible through the hatch.
