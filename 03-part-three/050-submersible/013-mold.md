Have you tried ringing the Cutter bell?

# Yes
Was it Baby Goal to answer the door? That's not a prank. Switch Goal to Spunky Goal to get more reaction.

# Reaction
She doesn't like it. Try again!

# Again!
Again and again. Third time is the charm.

# Ow
After ringing the bell for Spunky Goal three times Rufus' face shape is now in the door.

# And then?
You should mold the face. Maybe have some kind of wax.

# Wax?
Bozo's Cutter's technology is sometimes quite outdated. Like the lamps.

# Lamps
Open the Lamp and grab the candle.

# Wax
Put the candle into the Pot and melt it. Take the Pot.

# I have wax
Use the pot full of wax to the Dent and you have Impression. Put the impression into the suit.
