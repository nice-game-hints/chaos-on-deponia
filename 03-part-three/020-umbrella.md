At Porta Fisco there is a bum (Goon) with an umbrella. Go talk to him. Talk to him about the umbrella.

# Talked
He is hungry. You would need to provide him something to eat in exchange of the umbrella. If you talked with him you know that "Bums eat shoes".

# Shoes?
You know the old joke about fisherman fishing only boots when they are unlucky.

# Fisherman
There is a fisherman in Floating Black Market. You remember him. Talk to him until he starts to contest you about patience.

# Patience
Just stand next to him (after the conversation) and let Goal take care of the rest. He will, eventually, hand you a boot.

# Shoe
Give the shoe to Goon and you get the Umbrella.
