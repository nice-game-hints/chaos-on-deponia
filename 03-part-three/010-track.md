First part of you plan is to track the submersible by using the radio equipment at Isla Watchit.

# Where to start?
Start by talking with Goal at the bottom of the Radio Tower. You should talk with Spunky Goal (use Remote to change her).

# Plan
Yes, there is now some kind of plan. The radio transmitter is broken. Doc can fix it for you. Take the transmitter and hand it to Doc.

# It is fixed now
Now, go and mount it on the radio mast.

# Ow!
The lightning will hit you. You would need some kind of lightning rod. Did you talk to Baby Goal? You come up with a plan.

# Lightning plan
[Water](021-water.md) and [umbrella](020-umbrella.md)... Sounds like a plan to me.

# I have them
Put the pool in its place, pump it full of water and ask Goal to stand there. Switch her to Baby Goal (using Remote) to succeed. Give the umbrella to Goal. You can now try to climb again.

# Still. Ow!
Talk with Goal about the thunder rules again. You will also need [a tree](022-tree.md) and [win in lottery](023-lottery.md).

# I have those also
Ask Baby Goal to stand in the pool filled with water carrying the umbrella with the trees. Give her the lottery prize ticket. Now, go and put the transmitter (fixed by Doc) to the Radio Tower.
