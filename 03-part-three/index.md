You are chasing Donna-Goal. You have four places you can go:
 - Porta Fisco
 - North Pole
 - Isla Watchit
 - Floating Black Market
 
 Talk with all the people (Doc, Goal, Bozo, Rebels) and your plan will start to hatch.
 
# Plan?
Doc hints that you should go to Isla Watchit and tune the radio so that you can [track the submersible](010-track.md). Then you should use the [trained dolphins](040-adult-dolphins.md) with [torpedoes](030-torpedoes.md) to force Donna-Goal's submersible to surface.

# I did all of those
The dolphins are now energetic, you have the torpedoes and you have the tracker in place. Open the Lock (bottom left at Rebel Camp). The dolphins swim to the entrance. Give the torpedoes to the dolphins outside.

# Dolphins go!
Go back to the Cutter and look at the radar. It is a skippable minigame.
Let the hunt begin!
