There are cute baby dolphins at the Rebel Camp. They are so cute! Maybe you can teach them a trick. Or maybe there is another reason to get them out of the pool.

# A trick?
Like jumping through a hoop! Better yet, jumping through a burning hoop!

# Burning hoop?
Well, as we are in Deponia we must use impromptu tools. A burning tire would suffice.

# A burning tire?
Yes. [Get a torch](025-torch.md), light it in the Burning Barrel (Porta Fisco) and set the pile of tires on fire (Porta Fisco). One tire is there to grab.

# And then?
Set the tire on the service hatch for the dolphins to jump through it.

# They don't
Oh, you would need some incentive. Or a bait.

# Bait
I think the Fisherman (at Floating Black Market) had some. Go get one of his baits and use the bait on the tire.

# Noooo!!!
Well, we didn't see that coming... But you can now take the pool and some tuna with you.
