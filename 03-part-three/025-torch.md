The guy at the North Pole has interesting torch in his hand. You could really use that.

# How to melt it?
Well... as the portable fire is inside the ice you should melt it some other way. Have you looked at the Kidney Tea inside the Cutter?

# It's too hot!
Maybe cool it with something.

# With what?
There is a pile of snow outside the Cutter (at North Pole). Take the snow and put it into the tea. Drink the tea.
