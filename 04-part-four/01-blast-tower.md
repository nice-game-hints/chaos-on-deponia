You have emerged and Doc tells you that Cletus has kidnapped all Goals. There are three transporters left to you. They are your way into the Blast Tower.

# Transporters
When you transport yourself with a transporter you genetically mix with the animal in that transporter.

# What is my goal?
Try out the transporters. In the blast tower your goal is to exit the right most transporter as Rufus so that you can climb the ladders up and open the hatch.

# How?
Here's the sequence:
 - Enter fly transporter
 - At blast tower, as a fly enter the rightmost transporter
 - As Rufus, enter the rightmost transporter again, you come out as Rufus at the Blast Tower
 - Go upstairs and enter the transporter next to Toni
 - You come out as Rufus, enter the rightmost transporter again
 - At blast tower, as Rufus enter the upstairs transporter (with the frog)
 - As a frog, eat the fly from the transporter next to you
 - Go back to the blast tower, downstairs and use the transporter
 - Back down, as Rufus, use the leftmost transporter, you will replace the platypus on the right and you are Rufus
